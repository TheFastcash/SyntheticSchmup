### Technical ###
 * Working on Windows plateform                                                                                               -> OK
 * Can play with a keyboard or a controller (XBox or DualShock)

### GAMEPLAY ###
# Ship gameplay
 * Vertical ship Shooting                                                                                                     -> OK
 * Changing point-of-view (cf Astebreed : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMHoW8lQP6k)                                        -> Secondary
    (comment : J'ai ce jeu aussi, j'y ai peu joué, mais il est en 3D, un changement de vue impliquerait fortement de la 3D)
    ---> se limiter à une rotation de l'image de 90° (scrolling vertical et scrolling horizontal) pour rester en 2D
 * Talent tree depending of :                                                                                                 -> Possibility to improve capacity during game
        - enemy killed patterns (red/red/red = attack improved, bleu/green/green = displacement speed improved)
        - quantity of enemy type killed (several gauges, one by kind of enemy)
 * Posibility to buy weapons, special attacks, or AIs that can help for a short time                                          -> Capacity to unlock after a game / secret artefact linked to special kill series (sheep/enemies pattern...)
 * Different kind of ship (or the possibility to customize its shape and colour)
 * Wide universe, movements are totally free (and in some case can use oriented shooting)                                     -> NOK, too difficult

//  Some capacities will be unlocked after a trial, these capacities are attached
//   to a ship and can be improved during the trial (resetted after death)

# MULTIPLAYER (great improving but hard to implement)                                                                        -> Secondary
   * scoring
   * dedicated server : competition (puyo puyo) / coop

# Enemies
 * predefined pattern (simple to code)                                                                                       -> OK
 * learning/intelligent enemies (example : avoiding previously risky areas)                                                  -> Secondary
 * Ennemy ship cloning himself regularly (codename "cloning sheep")                                                          -> OK


### ART & DESIGN ###
# Kind of graphics
 * Abstract models (cf TxK : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5Y85LNLTf8)                                                     -> Decide between abstract/vectorial
 * Vectorial models                                                                                                           -> Decide between abstract/vectorial
 * Simple graphics                                                                                                            -> Yes but think about improve it
 * Maybe atomic shape/size objects (on joue avec des atomes, les munitions sont des rayons etc.)                              -> Bof
 * Environment defined by specific colors and enemies                                                                         -> OK


# Technic
 * Vector graphics                                                                                                            -> OK
 * 16/9 screen                                                                                                                -> OK
 * Selectable definition (HD, FHD, UHD)                                                                                       -> OK
 * Selectable zoom during gameplay                                                                                            -> NOK (or maybe a bonus to improve visibility or a special view for boss fight)

### STORY ###                                                                                                                 -> Secondary

 * Synthetic sounds preferred (Can use my own MM6 synthesizer with Audacity)                                                  -> OK
 * Interesting link for free music : http://korben.info/musique-libre-de-droit.html                                           -> OK
 * FL Studio is a good software https://www.image-line.com/flstudio/                                                          -> Secondary

# SOUND EFFECTS
 * Begin of level and death with special sound signature (example : Abe Odyssee)                                              -> OK
 * Look for free sound effect around space, ship, etc                                                                         -> Search for it
