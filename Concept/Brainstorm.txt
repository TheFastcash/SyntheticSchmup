### GAMEPLAY ###
# Ship gameplay
 * Vertical Shooting
 * Changing point-of-view (cf Astebreed : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMHoW8lQP6k)
    (comment : J'ai ce jeu aussi, j'y ai peu joué, mais il est en 3D, un changement de vue impliquerait fortement de la 3D)
 * Talent tree depending of :
        - enemy killed patterns
        - quantity of enemy type killed
 * Wide universe, movements are totally free (and in some case can use oriented shooting)
 * Different kind of ship (or the possibility to customize its shape and colour)
 * Posibility to buy weapons, special attacks, or AIs that can help for a short time
 * MULTIPLAYER !!! (I think that is very important, but may be hard to implement)

# Enemies behavior
 * predefined pattern (simple to code)
 * learning enemies (avoiding previously risky areas)


### ART & DESIGN ###
# Kind of graphics
 * Abstract models (cf TxK : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5Y85LNLTf8)
 * Simple graphics
 * Maybe atomic shape/size objects

# Technic
 * Vector graphics
 * 16/9 screen
 * Selectable definition (HD, FHD, UHD)
 * Selectable zoom during gameplay


### SOUNDS ###
# MUSIC
 * Use the music with smooth transitions depending on events
 * Synthetic sounds preferred(Can use my own MM6 synthesizer with Audacity)
 * Interesting link for free music : http://korben.info/musique-libre-de-droit.html
 * FL Studio is a good software https://www.image-line.com/flstudio/
        (Pay once, have it for ever with free updates)

# SOUND EFFECTS
 * Look for free sound effect around space, ship, etc
 * If there is a story, add vocals ? (even if it is yaourt voices)
