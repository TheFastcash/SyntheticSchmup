* IDE :
    Code::Blocks (I used it for a long time, it is not dead (thare are still updates)) :
        + Still being updated
        + Can add plugins
* Main libraries (gaming libraries) :
    SDL :
        - coded in C
    SFML :
        + Coded in C++
        + Has a sound library
    Allegro 5 :
        - coded in C
* Coding rules :
    * Tabs and spaces :
        * Use spaces rather than tabs
        * 1 tab = 4 spaces
    * Brackets :
        * Opening brackets ("{") can be set at the end of a line or right under at the same indent
        * Use brackets ("{" and "}") inside a "case" in the switch statement
        * Brackets ("{" and "}") can be used to surround a bunch of lines (can be useful when we want to fold that bunch)
        * If there are more than 1 closing bracket ("}") in a row, can be set in the same line (but keep the good indent for each of them)
        * You must indent after an opening bracket ("{")
    * Comments :
        * Each function must have a comment right after the opening bracket with the last update date, the last test date, and a global explaining of the function
        
        
        
    Example :
        // Example to define
    
    
    
* Architecture :
    // Tu entends quoi par architecture ?
